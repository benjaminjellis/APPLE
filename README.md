# APPLE  [![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)


**A**rtificial neural networks for **P**rediction of **P**remier **L**eague gam**E**s, **APPLE** for short, is a project to utilise ANNs to create models that can be used to predict Premier League games.

## Status
APPLE is currently under post Phase 1 refactoring and development. 

Phase 1 was a phase of real world testing where APPLE was tested against 3 human predictors of games. Evaluation of Phase 1 can be found in the notebook [here!](https://github.com/benjaminjellis/APPLE/blob/master/docs/Phase_1/APPLE_Phase1_evaluation_results.ipynb)

With the start of the 2020/21 Premier League season will come Phase 2 which will be another phase of real world testing while APPLE is also continuously upgraded.
