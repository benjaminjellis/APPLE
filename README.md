# APPLE  [![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)


**A**rtificial neural networks for **P**rediction of **P**remier **L**eague gam**E**s, **APPLE** for short, is a project to utilise ANNs to create models that can be used to predict Premier League games.

## APPLE in action
APPLE's main use currently is to compete against human predictors. This is done using STRUDEL and [BeatTheBot](https://beatthebot.co.uk/#/login)
More details on STRUDEL can be found [here.](https://github.com/BrownKnight/STRUDEL)

## Status
APPLE is currently under Phase 2 testing and development. 

Phase 1 was a phase of real world testing where APPLE was tested against 3 human predictors of games. Evaluation of Phase 1 can be found in the notebook [here.](https://github.com/benjaminjellis/APPLE/blob/master/docs/Phase_1/APPLE_Phase1_evaluation_results.ipynb)

## Credits
APPLE is trained on data from https://www.football-data.co.uk/
