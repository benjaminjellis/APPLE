# APPLE 
[![PEP8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

**A**rtificial neural networks for **P**rediction of **P**remier **L**eague gam**E**s, **APPLE** for short, is a project to utilise ANNs to create models that can be used to predict Premier League games.


## Motivation 

After discovering a source of data for Premier League games I attempted to build a few ANNs to predict games. This morphed into APPLE which is now a whole project built around the ANNs. 


## Status
APPLE is currently under Phase 1 real world testing where it's being tested aginast human predictors of games. The weekly predictions and resutls so far of this testing can be found in weekly results.ipynb. 

APPLE is also under continuous development, currently the following 3 areas are being developed:
- Hyperparamter Opttimisation of models 
- Automation of data mining 
- Implementation of backtesting regime for contents monitoring of model performance

Phase 1 is due to end with the 19/20 Premier League season and at this point APPLE will be upgraded ahead of the 20/21 season


## Credits
My thanks to everyone at https://www.football-data.co.uk/ for providing the data APPLE is based on
